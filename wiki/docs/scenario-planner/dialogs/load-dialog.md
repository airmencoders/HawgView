Users are able to select a scenario saved on their computer to load into Hawg View.

Click on the ++"Select File"++ to open a `File Upload` dialog to then navigate to and select a Hawg View scenario file. Once a file has been selected, it will automatically be loaded into Hawg View.

If a file is malformed or not a Hawg View scenario, it will fail to load and an alert will be presented to the user notifying them of this case.
