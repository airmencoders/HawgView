When clicking the save dialog, users will be presented with an optional field to name the scenario. This will be used to uniquely identify the downloaded file as well as identify to the system the name of the scenario once loaded back into Hawg View.

Clicking on the ++"Download Scenario"++ button will then download the file to your computer based on your preferences wherever downloads are saved.
