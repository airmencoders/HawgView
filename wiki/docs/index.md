# Hawg View

Designed by a CAS pilot for the entire CAS team. Integration is essential to CAS and with Hawg View, mission planning takes less time, allows you to share scenarios, CONOPs, and GRGs with the entire team. As a web based mission planning tool, you can mission plan at home, while teleworking, and use it as a visual aid for flight briefs and debriefs
